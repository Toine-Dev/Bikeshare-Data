### Project Title
Bike Share Data Interactive Dialogue Box

### Description
A very simple interactive dialogue box which returns bike share statistics by prompting the user to pick:
i)a city which can either be New York or Washington or Chicago;
ii)a specific month or all of the months from January to June;
iii)a specific day of the week or the entire week.
Each time the user inputs something, the program asks for confirmation.
This program also features an autocorrect: it is able to understand some common typos.
